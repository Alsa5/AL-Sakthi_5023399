Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential in Handling Large Inventories
Data structures and algorithms are crucial in handling large inventories because they determine the efficiency of data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Efficient data structures can significantly reduce the time complexity of operations such as searching for a product, updating product details, and maintaining an organized and scalable inventory. Algorithms help in optimizing these operations, ensuring the system can handle a large volume of data without performance degradation.

Suitable Data Structures for Inventory Management
ArrayList: Good for storing a collection of products when the primary operations are iterations and indexed access. It provides constant time complexity for adding elements at the end and linear time complexity for search operations.
HashMap: Ideal for scenarios where quick access to products via a unique identifier (e.g., productId) is required. It provides average constant time complexity for add, update, and delete operations due to hashing.

Choosing the Data Structure
I've used a HashMap to store the products because it allows for fast access, addition, and deletion of products using the product ID as the key.

Time Complexity of Operations
Add Operation:
Time complexity: O(1) on average because HashMap uses hashing for insertion.
Update Operation:
Time complexity: O(1) on average for the same reason as the add operation.
Delete Operation:
Time complexity: O(1) on average because HashMap uses hashing for deletion.
Search Operation:
Time complexity: O(1) on average for searching by product ID.
Optimization
Ensuring that the hash function distributes the keys uniformly minimizes collisions.
Load factor management: Maintaining an appropriate load factor to balance between space and time efficiency. A typical load factor is 0.75.
Used concurrent data structures like ConcurrentHashMap to handle multiple threads concurrently.
